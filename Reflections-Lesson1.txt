-How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug?
	Using the diff or fc commands in a bash or prompt to error easier to see in a files.

-How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	Using versions control, to see changes in the code if a problem in a new version, return at old version and check

-What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	Google Docs save versions automatically that any changes in file and so difficult to see bugs, and git you work functionally logical minimal changes to see, working later version and most earlier version.

-Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	git save multiple files in one commit because, see that every changes (insertions, deletions) in thoses commit's using a command git log --stat
